            Hi, my name is Kallum, and I am a universtity student approaching the end of my first year computer science course.<br>
            I have a small background of object oriented programming, starting my first project about 7 years ago. <br>
            A link to my GitHub can be found <a  href="https://github.com/KallumP">here.</a> <br>
            Or to look at the list of projects I have worked on (with a small summary of each project), within this website, click the "Projects" in the banner at the top.
