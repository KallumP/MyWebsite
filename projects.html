            <p class="AimTrainer">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/AimTrainer">Aim Trainer</a> is an application that can be used to help improve one's 2D mouse aim. This is mostly helpful for aim in game, but can also be used just to help get used the sensitivity of a mouse outside of games too. This project helps me get used to timers, as each target will need to spawn based on a timer that ticks faster each spawn, and each target will need to decrease in size, which will happen after each tick of a timer inside of the target class. After finishing this project in windows forms, I plan on making the project work in a WPF project, which will allow me to draw graphics out faster. So I can give each target a graphic without worrying about the program slowing down. I will be using win 2D to draw these graphics. <br> <br>

            <p class="EverWing">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/EverWingGame">Everwing</a> is a mobile game on facebook which I have tried to replicate using C#. There are many new aspects to this that I haven't covered before, such as shop system,that allows the user to level up their character over time, instead of starting the game with the same stats each time. This means that I need to be able to save the state of the character, and load that in each time the game starts. (unfinished) <br> <br>

            <p class="FourierSerires">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/FourierSeries">Fourier Series</a> is a project that allows me to visualise the way sin waves are combined to make any desired signal. The size and the angular velocity of each phasor that is added to the signal can be altered in the program. The size of the drawn signal can be altered aswell to make the drawing easier to look at, or to show more of the signal. The other half to this would be taking in a signal, and making a set of phasors which can replicate that same signal, but that has not been done yet.<br> <br>

            <p class="Paint">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/PaintProgram">Paint</a> was my first big project which I spent about 3 months working on. There were many different aspects to this which I had never come across before, and it really helped to broaden my knowledge about problem solving. <br>A large aspect of this program for me was making the entire thin without using most of the C# windows forms tools (for example, instead of using buttons, I used a picture box to draw out each button, and calculated the location of the click based on what picture box was clicked). Doing things this way, makes expandablity much easier. There were only a few pictureboxes for me to contstrian, instead of trying relocate each of the buttons. This meant that each time the window was resized, I was able to easily relocate the objects, because there wasnt very many of them. I managed to turn about 20 buttons into 6 picture boxes.<br>In this project, I also worked with saveing and loading project files. This consisted of outputting every variable and object status to a text file (easy part), and then reading each line of a text file to create objects and set up the program to be exactly the same as the saved project. Loading project files was a very difficult part of this, and I have yet to complete one part (loading the pen drawigns). Saving the image file was relatively easy. I just had to create a bit map, the size of the drawing, and draw to it the same way I drew to the picturebox. (unfinished)<br> <br>

            <p class="FlappyBird">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/FlappyBird">Flappy Bird</a> was a small remake of the original mobile game. The main goal of this project, was to try and get used to making variabled spawning (something that isnt predetermined), in this case it would be the way that the pipes spawned in. This turned out to be a very easy feature to implement. <br>I also ended up learning a lot about efficient coding with this project. An example of this would be the way that I removed the pipes from the game environment, originally I checked each of the pipes in the game to see if they had gone off the screen, however this was a very inefficent way of dealing with the problem, and I found that I only ever had to check the first pipe in the list. I also used this same idea for collisions between the bird and the pipes, I only ever had to check the first pipe.<br>After finding out how easy the variabled spawning would be, I decided that I would work on a leaderboard system. In order to rank the scores, I wanted to use a new sorting sytem that I was quite unfamiliar with; Linked Lists. Creating a system that stored the data using pointers that point to the next data location turned out to be very challenging, and I decided to create a small side project that only dealt with this feature, until I had it all worked out. And then I implemented it into my main game.<br> <br>

            <p class="TrackingAI">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/TrackingAI">Tracking ai</a> was a small project that I worked on alongside my A-level coursework. I made it to experiment with having two objects following each other, which I would later use as a feature in my coursework.<br>In order to make this work, I used pythagoras' therom to calculate the distance between the two objects in terms of an x distance and a y distance, and then used a ratio to scale that triangle of x and y down to have a hypotenuse of a set value. Then I just had to add a velocity of that hypotenuse's x and y to the object.<br>An improvement I can make to this would be to use forces to move my objects (newtonian physics), instead of just changing the velocity. In this project, I only calculated the direction each object had to travel in, and then applied a velocity change in that direction. I could do this by applying forces to each object and having them accelerate in the right direction from that.<br> <br>

            <p class="BunkerEscape">
                <a href="https://github.com/KallumP/BunkerEscape">Bunker escape</a> was the first big project that I worked on, it as a part of my A-Level coursework, and was where I learnt the majority of my object oriented programming knowledge.<br>There are many aspects of this project that are inefficient, and I have used a lot of bad programming practices.<br>Some improvements I could have made would have been adding animation, sounds, and having different classes for the different room item, instead of having one class that had a variable that stored what type of item it was.<br> <br>
